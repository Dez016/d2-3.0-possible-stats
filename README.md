D2armorpicker sliders also might come in the future, depending on how smooth I can make it.

I am missing a few class items, and some class item rolls are extrapolated. If you happen to have a Dragon/Husk exotic class item, please send its stats to dezedz on discord. Also, if you notice a bug where the program's class item doesn't match the in-game one, please tell me.

(ty aegis for giving me his class item stash's stats)

To run, run statfinder.exe
